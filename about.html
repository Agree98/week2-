        <p>The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes
            The Avengers is a team of superheroes that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and first appeared in The Avengers #1 in 1963. Over the years, the team has become one of the most iconic and beloved groups in comic book history, and later, in film.
            
            Original Comic Team
            The original Avengers lineup consisted of:
            
            Iron Man (Tony Stark)
            
            Thor (the Norse God of Thunder)
            
            Hulk (Bruce Banner)
            
            Ant-Man (Hank Pym)
            
            Wasp (Janet Van Dyne)
            
            They were brought together to stop the villain Loki, Thor's half-brother. Eventually, Captain America (Steve Rogers) joined the team in issue #4, becoming one of the most prominent leaders of the Avengers.
            
            Team Concept
            The core idea of the Avengers is that, as the tagline goes: “And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth’s mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat…” The team assembles whenever a powerful villain or cosmic threat is too much for one hero alone.

            The Avengers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
            The Avengers became globally famous thanks to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with individual films that led to The Avengers (2012), directed by Joss Whedon. The MCU team included:

            Captain America (Chris Evans)
            
            Thor (Chris Hemsworth)
            
            Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)
            
            Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)
            
            Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)
            
            The MCU's Avengers saga culminated in epic crossover films like:
            
            Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)

            These movies are some of the highest-grossing films of all time and brought unprecedented attention to superhero storytelling.
            
            Legacy
            The Avengers symbolize teamwork, sacrifice, and heroism. Whether in comics, animation, or film, the team's legacy continues to inspire audiences with stories of unity in the face of overwhelming danger.
